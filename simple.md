# Sample documentation outline

Elements such as paragraphs and headers have no adverse effects. Only the first bullet list is significant. The first item of the bullet list reprents the documentation project title, i.e. the title of the `index.html`

Documentation topics go under the first item as a child bullet list.

* Documentation project title
  * First documentation topic
  * Second documentation topic
  * Third documentation topic
